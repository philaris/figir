Description: With the functions in this package you can check the
  validity of the following financial instrument identifiers:
  FIGI (Financial Instrument Global Identifier
  <https://www.openfigi.com/about/figi>),
  CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures
  <https://www.cusip.com/identifiers.html#/CUSIP>),
  ISIN (International Securities Identification Number
  <https://www.cusip.com/identifiers.html#/ISIN>),
  SEDOL (Stock Exchange Daily Official List
  <https://www2.lseg.com/SEDOL-masterfile-service-tech-guide-v8.6>).
  You can also calculate the FIGI checksum of 11-character strings,
  which can be useful if you want to create your own FIGI identifiers.
